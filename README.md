# GCD-PeerGradedAssigment

A repo where I have put my final project of the course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

## Files that we use in `run_analysis.R`

- `./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt` (This contains the activities from which the test data come)
- `./UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt` (This contains the activities from which the train data come)
- `./UCI HAR Dataset/test/x_test.txt` (This contains the test data set)
- `./UCI HAR Dataset/train/x_train.txt` (This contains the train data set)
- `./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt` (This contains the list of variables names of the raw data)

## Analysis

You can open the `run_analysis.R` to see what I do with the raw data in order to obtain a tidy data set that I describe below. In this file I comment the code to explain the analysis.

## We have created the files

- `./codebook.md` (This contains all information about variables)
- `./run_analysis.R` (This contains all the instruction to get from raw/separated data set to tidy data set)
- `./README.md` (This is this file)
- `./tidydataset.txt` (This contains the tidy data set)


You have to run the file `./run_analysis.R` to do the analysis and obtain the tidy data set.
